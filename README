This is what I want this to do:

1. Hold a ROOT file of all user data given a specific data format
2. The executable will be able to do the following:
	-Add user
		*If add is used, it adds that user to the ROOT
	-Create transaction for user (different types)
		*If create transaction is used, it will add a transaction to the ROOT file for that user
	-Check history of a user
		*Return all of a user's values
3. A transaction will have the following:
	-Type
		*Monthly payment via cash
		*Monthly payment via coffee
		*Reimbursement for coffee
	-Value
		*+ if payment
		*- if reimbursement
	-Note
		*examples: venmo-maxx; bought starbucks coffee beans

If designed properly, I can then easily play with and look at thsi data
**Do csv for now
